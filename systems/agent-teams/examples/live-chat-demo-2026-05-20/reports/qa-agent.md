# QA Agent Report

## Scope
Validate CLI behavior from backend handoff for:
- `add`
- `list`
- `done`
- `delete`
- persistence + invalid input handling

## Test Artifact
- Log: `/root/.openclaw/workspace/systems/agent-teams/examples/live-chat-demo-2026-05-20/artifacts/qa-test.log`
- CLI tested: `/root/.openclaw/workspace/systems/agent-teams/examples/live-chat-demo-2026-05-20/artifacts/todo-cli.js`

## Environment
- Local Node.js runtime
- No package install
- Data file reset before test run (`todo-data.json` removed)

## Test Cases Executed (13)
### Positive
1. Empty list -> `No todos yet.` (exit 0)
2. Add task A (exit 0)
3. Add task B (exit 0)
4. List after adds -> shows #1/#2 pending (exit 0)
5. Done #1 (exit 0)
6. List after done -> #1 completed, #2 pending (exit 0)
7. Delete #2 (exit 0)
8. List after delete -> #2 removed (exit 0)
9. Persistence list -> state retained across invocations (exit 0)

### Negative
10. `done x` -> validation error + usage (exit 1)
11. `delete 999` -> not found (exit 1)
12. unknown command `foo` -> invalid command + usage (exit 1)
13. `add` missing text -> validation error + usage (exit 1)

## Result Summary
- Passed: 13/13 expected behaviors observed.
- Positive flow stable.
- Error handling stable with proper non-zero exit for invalid input.
- Persistence works using `todo-data.json`.

## Notes
- ID behavior matches handoff note: `nextId` increments and does not reuse deleted IDs.
- Final snapshot in log confirms:
  - only todo #1 remains
  - #1 marked completed
  - `nextId` is `3`

## QA Verdict
**PASS** for current demo scope.
